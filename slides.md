----

> Casualness makes us ok with bad culture, busiwork, and unhealthy practices

----

## Conformity

> If you see a change that needs to be made and don't, you're a part of the problem.

note:
- elivator standing study, people will conform to the group
- nobody changes so nothing changes. so nobody changes

----

## 2D/3D content
- 2D fact-based - text, email
- 3D rich/nuanced - phone, in person

note:
there are two types of data, 2D and 3D and they have appropriate mediums of transfer

2D - content and fact-based should be communicated with text, email
3D - rich and nuanced communication with meetings, phone, and in person
When we send 3D content via 2D methods it breaks down, and vice versa. Causes frustration.

----

## Delegation
> Allow people to fail. Hands off.

note:
1st tier people are people you trust. Delegate to 2nd tier - delegate to people you don't fully trust yet, in order to build a stronger, larger 1st tier

> If you solve a real problem, you don't have to spend as much on marketing - the customer will come to you

----

> If you want to be a success, identify a human need and reach out to solve it

----

## Big vision
Be willing to break it into managable bites

note:
I'm going to connect all of Africa with fiber. Be willing to break the vision down for people: just these two countries. Then two more, eventually, the vision was captured and understood.

----

> We need to treat the best of our people as volunteers, they could be working anywhere else.

note:
Respect the people who work for us

----

## Leverage
- no monopoly on intelligence
- trust your team
- create a safe place

note:
Leverage - there is no monopoly on intelligence, someone on the team can do it. Encourage leaders. The secret of power is to give it away. Create  a safe place where the team members can contribute

----

## Authenticity
- comfort in your own skin
- meeting before the meeting

note:
Authenticity - authenticity is at the heart of your power. Most people are not comfortable in their own skin, so when they see it in others, they're drawn to it. The meeting before the meeting allows you to be an authentic person. Think about who you are. 

Story: Fixed Income party, invited to sing, followup conversation with head of department, also on the selection committee. Authenticity, bring your real self, because you don't know which real self will connect.

----

## Buy-in
- make a plan
- hear people out
- adjust or confirm plan

note:
Get buy-in: talk to individuals about the vision, get their feedback, even if you have a plan alreadyâ€“it might change, it might not.

## Diversity and Innovation
Cultural intelligence is key to a high-functioning diverse team

note:
- [Cultural knowledge without good strategy/action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWynJkN5HbQ)

note:
Bad news - they stink, which is good because it shows that you care for the mission and the people

----

## Internal story

- who's right?
- who's fault is it?
- what was the intent?

note:
Everyone has an internal voice with this story:
Change the story, change the 3 questions to align better with reality:

----

## Re-write the internal story
note:
- who's right? what's this conversation really about?
- who's fault is it? what have we each contributed? for good or ill?
- what was the intent? separate intent from impact, what's the impact?
- No silver bullet, consistency is important
